Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare type of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system.
The lymphatic system has tubes that branch through all parts of the body. It carries a colourless liquid called lymph. This liquid circulates around the body tissues. It contains a high number of white blood cells (lymphocytes) which fight infection.
When you have lymphoma, some of your white blood cells (lymphocytes) don't work properly. They start to divide constantly but don't develop fully. So they can't fight infection as normal white blood cells do.
There are two main types of lymphocytes : B cells and T cells
Mantle cell lymphoma affects the B cells. It develops in the part of the lymph node called the mantle zone. The abnormal B lymphocytes start to collect in the lymph nodes or body organs. They can then form tumours and begin to cause problems within the lymphatic system or the organ where they are growing.
