Follicular lymphoma is a cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. They help your body fight infections.
There are two types of lymphomas: Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's, based on the kind of white blood cell they affect. Follicular lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
When you have follicular lymphoma, the sick blood cells can travel to many parts of your body, such as your organs, bone marrow, and lymph nodes (pea-sized glands in your neck, groin, and under your arms that are part of your immune system). The blood cells can form tumors in these places.
Although follicular lymphoma usually can't be cured, you can live long and well with it. This cancer grows slowly. You may not need treatment for many years, or ever. But if you do, it usually works well. Many people will have long-term remission after treatment.
