A non-cancerous (benign) tumour of the colon or rectum is a growth that does not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Non-cancerous tumours are not usually life-threatening. Most non-cancerous tumours are polyps
that are attached to the lining of the colon or rectum. They usually stick out from the lining and grow toward the hollow centre of the colon or rectum.
Non-cancerous tumours of the colon or rectum are usually found during a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. They are removed so they can be examined under a microscope to make a diagnosis. Surgery to remove them is the usual treatment.
