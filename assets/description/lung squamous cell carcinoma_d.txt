Squamous cell lung cancer, or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, is one type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Squamous cell lung cancer is categorized as such by how the cells look under a microscope. Squamous cell lung cancer begins in the squamous cells—thin, flat cells that look like fish scales when seen under a microscope. They line the inside of the airways in the lungs. Squamous cell lung cancer is also called epidermoid carcinoma.1,2
Squamous cell lung tumors usually occur in the central part of the lung or in one of the main airways (left or right bronchus). The tumor’s location is responsible for symptoms such as cough, trouble breathing, chest pain, and blood in the sputum. 
If the tumor grows to a large size, a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT or CAT ) scan may detect a cavity in the lung. A cavity is a gas- or fluid-filled space within a tumor mass or nodule and is a classic sign of squamous cell lung cancer. Squamous cell lung cancer can spread to multiple sites, including the brain, spine and other bones, adrenal glands, and liver.3,4,5
