Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. Drusen are made up of lipids and proteins. Drusen can be different sizes—small, medium, and large. Small drusen are common in those 50 and older without age-related macular degeneration (AMD). But having many small drusen and larger drusen are often signs of AMD.
Drusen can also occur in the optic nerve. Unlike drusen in the retina, optic nerve drusen can cause minor loss of peripheral (side) vision. Optic nerve drusen are not related to aging and are a completely different condition. They’re seen in both children and adults.
