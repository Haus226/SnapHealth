Watchful waiting or active surveillance : If your healthcare provider recommends watchful waiting, you’ll have regular appointments so they can do physical examinations, laboratory tests and imaging tests.
Radiation therapy : Healthcare providers may use radiation therapy to treat early-stage follicular lymphoma.
Monoclonal antibody therapy : Healthcare providers use lab-created antibodies designed to find and kill specific cancer cells.
Chemotherapy : Healthcare providers may use chemotherapy alone or combine chemotherapy with other treatments.
Targeted therapy : Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells without hurting normal cells.
Immunotherapy : Immunotherapy stimulates your immune system. Treatments can fuel your body’s production of cancer-fighting cells or help healthy cells identify and attack cancer cells.
