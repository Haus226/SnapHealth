Malignant tumors are cancerous and may be aggressive because they invade and damage surrounding tissue. When a tumor is suspected to be malignant, the doctor will perform a biopsy to determine the severity or aggressiveness of the tumor.
Metastatic cancer is when cancer cells of a malignant tumor spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph system or by using the blood stream, and form a secondary tumor. These secondary tumors, known as metastatic disease, are still made up of breast cancer cells, but are now located inside other organs, such as the bones, liver, or lungs.
