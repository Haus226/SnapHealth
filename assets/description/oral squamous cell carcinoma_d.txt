Oral cancers form when cells on the lips or in the oral develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations changes tell the cells to continue growing and dividing when healthy cells would die. The accumulating abnormal oral cancer cells can form a tumor. With time they may spread inside the oral and on to other areas of the head and neck or other parts of the body.
Oral cancers most commonly begin in the flat, thin cells (squamous cells) that line your lips and the inside of your oral. Most oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.
