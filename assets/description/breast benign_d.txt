A non-cancerous (benign) tumour of the breast is a growth that does not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Non-cancerous tumours are usually not life-threatening.
Non-cancerous tumours are usually found during an imaging test that is being done for another reason, such as an x-ray. Non-cancerous tumours and cancerous tumours look very different on test images. Non-cancerous tumours are smaller, have smooth shapes and have more calcium and patterns in them. Cancerous tumours are larger, have irregular shapes and have less calcium and fewer patterns in the tumour.
Most of the time, non-cancerous tumours do not need any treatment, because these tumours grow very slowly, if at all. Your healthcare team may send you for regular imaging tests to watch for any changes to the tumour. If there are changes such as an increase in size, or the tumour starts to cause symptoms, your healthcare team may do a biopsy or offer you surgery to remove the tumour.
